# ActivityRecognition

Human activity sensing has many applications. One may use the accelerometer and gyroscope on a
smart phone to detect the motion of the phone itself, which can be used to infer activities that the
user holding the phone is involved with, the environment and context. Identify the specific type of
activity you plan to detect, the set of sensors that you will use, implement your algorithm, and then
perform evaluations. Visualization/UI can be simple. The core challenge is the data/signal analysis.
